## **Features**  

- **Global Ilumination**<br>
Implements [*Screen Space Visibility Bitmask Indirect Lighting*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.11376) (SSVBIL) to achieve real-time global illumination with minimal performance overhead, leveraging bitmask-based visibility approximation for accurate indirect light bounces in complex scenes.  

- Photorealistic, real-time, and fast **Atmospheric Scattering**<br>
Combines [*Unreal Engine's Sky Atmosphere model*](https://sebh.github.io/publications/egsr2020.pdf) with [*Epipolar Sampling*](https://gdcvault.com/play/1018227/Practical-Implementation-of-Light-Scattering) for real-time volumetric light shafts and wavelength-dependent sky rendering, enabling dynamic time-of-day transitions and physically accurate aerial perspective.  

- High-quality, fast, and adaptive **Shadows**<br> 
Deploys adaptive shadow resolution via [*Rectilinear Texture Warping*](https://www.cspaul.com/publications/Rosen.2012.I3D.pydf), reducing aliasing artifacts while maintaining <2ms rendering cost, with variable penumbra simulation for contact-hardened soft shadows.  

<!-- **Technical Distinction**: Unifies academic advancements (SSVBIL, Epipolar Sampling) with production-proven techniques (UE Sky Atmosphere) to balance innovation and practicality, targeting AAA game engines and VFX pipelines. -->
